# PrWeb
Repo for the Web Tech project 
A team project for university for the Web Technologies course.
The project consists of a backend and frontend for an website for bug tracking.
The frontend is made using React.js and the backend is made using Node.js .
The frontend is incomplete but the backend should in theory work as intended.
The app can be tested after the server is started and the npm install and npm start commands.
The server can be tested separately in case you want this, you just need to start it and use POSTMAN to test the REST API.
